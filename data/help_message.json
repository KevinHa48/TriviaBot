When the question is announced, DM the bot your answer (case-insensitive) using the `!answer` command. An example would be `!answer my answer here`. **You will have 3 attempts for each question, and each attempt will be counted towards the current question**, so answer carefully! This means that you cannot answer a question that was asked previously.\n\n3. When each question is finished, players who answered correctly will earn 1 point. \n\n4. When all rounds are finished, the contestants with the highest score will be entered into a raffle to win a prize. Winners will be announced on the `#Quick-on-the-Trigger` channel and will receive a DM from the bot."
